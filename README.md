# OpenAir NFT Market Place

## Description

This project, in it’s end state will be an e-commerce application that will allow users to create NFT’s, as well as a site that for the users to buy and sell NFT art using blockchain/cryptocurrencies technologies. This application will be using the Linux OS, JavaScript and the Motoko language. This application will be an Internet Computer based application using canisters to contain both the source code and software state.

Currently this is a two part project with the part in another VSC folder, that utilizes the Linux OS and Motoko computer language throough the Ubuntu application/ linux emulator. They will work together, but currently that side of the project is still underdevelopment.

This application currently uses a full MERN stack, MongoDB handles the database, Express.js and Node.js manages the server and application logic, and React.js is used for the front-end user interface. This application also currently uses Stirp to facilitate the purchase and sale of NFT art. 

- I wanted to build and E-Commerce site that would allow for the buying and selling of NFT art using blockchain technologies.
- I've always been interested in creating an E-Commerce site and wanted to build something involving blockchains..
- This allows the users to create NFT art as well as sell the art. 
- I learned that to do this I would have to learn how to use Linux OS and how to code in the Motoko language.
